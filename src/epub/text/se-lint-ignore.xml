		<ignore>
			<code>t-005</code>
			<reason>There is no ending comma for the phrase "of course" because it denotes the specific phrase--much like how it's used here--as opposed to an actual quote. No ending comma needed.</reason>
		</ignore>
		<ignore>
			<code>t-042</code>
			<reason>The paragraph lacks ending punctuation because its contents are directly continued in the next one. The source formats Dick's name as on a separate line from the rest of the paragraph, and I decided to replicate that. No ending punctuation needed for this paragraph.</reason>
